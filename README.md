# Navbar

### **How to design navber using for html & css:

- A CSS Navbar (Navigation Bar) is a key component in web design, providing users with a set of links to navigate through the website. It’s usually placed at the top of the webpage but can also be found on the side or bottom. Designed to be responsive, a well-crafted navbar should adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

In CSS, you style the navbar using properties like flexbox, grid, or float to arrange the items horizontally or vertically. You can also use hover effects to enhance the interactivity, ensuring that users have a clear and intuitive navigation experience. Elements within the navbar, such as logos, menus, and dropdowns, are styled to be visually appealing and user-friendly.
